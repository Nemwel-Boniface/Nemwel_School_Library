# Nemwel's School Library

In this project, I feature as a librarian of St Nemwel's University, I need a tool to help me record what books are in the universitie's library and who borrows them. The app that I will create will allow me to:

    Add new students or teachers.
    Add new books.
    Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way using Ruby!


Enjoy!
